# iTunes Rich Presence for Discord
This is an application that lets you have a personalized Discord status based on what you're listening to on iTunes (or Music, if you're on MacOS 10.15+). The status will show the song name, artist, album name, time elapsed since the track started playing and index of the track in the album. Additionally, an image with a "playing" or "paused" button will be shown in case the track is playing or paused. For some examples, see the [screenshots](#screenshots).

## Features
* Simple to use.
* No in-app login required.
* Lightweight (~1.5MB file).
* Works on both MacOS and Windows.
* Ugly UI.
* Some customization options on how the Discord status will be displayed.

## Requirements
* **MacOS** / **Windows**.
* A Java Runtime Environment (**JRE**), minimum version **1.8** (you can download it from [here](https://java.com/download/)).
* If the application displays an error window even when everything is set up correctly, installing the Java Development Kit will fix the issue (you can download it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)).
* [iTunes](https://www.apple.com/itunes/download/) (or *Music*, if using MacOS 10.15+) and [Discord](https://discordapp.com/download) applications.
* For **Windows** users: this application should work for iTunes version 4.7 or later.

## Usage
* Download the application as:
  * *jar*: it can be run on either OS.
  * *dmg*: image that contains the *.app* bundle that can be run on **MacOS** as a native application (double click on the .dmg file, then extract the .app file to wherever you want).
  * *exe*: executable that can be run on **Windows** as a native application.
* All of these versions can be found [*here*](https://github.com/kevinmussi/iTunes-Discord-RP/releases/latest) under *Assets*
* Double click on it.
* Done!

### Homebrew
If you're a Mac user and have [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) installed, you can easily install this app as a Cask (it'll also update automatically when using the cask upgrade command, and it doesn't require you to bypass Gatekeeper). All you need to do is run this command:

`brew install --cask kkevinm/itunes-discord-rp/itunesdiscordrp`

This will tap the itunes-discord-rp repository and then install the cask like normal.

## F.A.Q.
1) * *Q*: The application runs fine, but my status won't update, what do I do?
   * *A*: go to ```Settings -> Game Activity``` and make sure the option *Display currently running game as a status message* is on. Additionally, the status won't be displayed while your Discord status is set to **invisible**.
2) * *Q*: Gatekeeper won't let me run the app/jar on my Mac!
   * *A*: Right-click on the app/jar file and hit **Open**. Then hit **Open** in the dialog that appears. After doing it this way, the app should open fine just by double clicking on it.
3) * *Q*: Can I hide the app's window?
   * *A*: Yes, if your system supports it, the app will show a button on the menu bar / system tray. Clicking on it will hide (or show, if clicking it again) the main window.
4) * *Q*: I get "JRELoadError" when trying to open the .app!
   * *A*: This should be fixed by installing the [latest version of the JRE](https://www.java.com/download/).
5) * *Q*: I'm on Mac and the app seems to freeze often (for example, the status on Discord doesn't update after a while).
   * *A*: This can be caused by App Nap, a feature that puts apps to sleep when they're in the background. You can try disabling App Nap by pasting this line in the Terminal and hitting <kbd>enter</kbd> (afterwards, restart the computer to make it take effect):
   
     `defaults write NSGlobalDomain NSAppSleepDisabled -bool YES`
6) * *Q*: Can you make so the album cover of the playing song is shown in the status?
   * *A*: No, Discord doesn't allow you to upload pictures dynamically (outside of special applications like Spotify).
7) * *Q*: Can you change "Playing Music" to "Listening to Music"?
   * *A*: No, the public Rich Presence API currently doesn't let you change the type of activity in the status.

## To-dos
* Javadocs.
* Unit tests.
* Spotify integration (easy but rather useless).
* Command line only interface.
* ~~Allow customization of the rich presence elements.~~
* Make it a menu bar app for MacOS.
